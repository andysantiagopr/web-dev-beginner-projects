# Odin Recipes

A simple project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) designed to practice basic HTML skills.  
This site will contain a main index page with links to a few recipes. Each recipe page will demonstrate:

- Proper use of headings, paragraphs, and lists  
- Adding images and links  
- Structuring content with semantic HTML  

The goal is to build a foundation in web development while creating a small but functional recipe website.
